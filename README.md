[Towers of Hanoi][towers-wiki] is a classic mathematical puzzle where the player tries to transport a pyramid of disks from one location to another. Only one disk can be moved at a time, from the top of one stack to the top of another. Disks can only be placed on an empty stack or a disk of a larger radius.

This version of the game leverages jQuery to handle player interactions.
